"""Hardcoded catalog of Claude model ids that are available to the OAuth pool.

The list is intentionally static. Anthropic publishes new model ids via the
``https://api.anthropic.com/v1/models`` endpoint for API-key callers, but
Max/Pro/Team subscription OAuth callers do NOT have access to that endpoint at
runtime. Instead we ship a pinned allow-list of model ids that are known to be
eligible for the subscription tier as of the change date.

Any id in :data:`KNOWN_CLAUDE_MODELS` MUST be a currently-published Anthropic
model id; see ``is_known_claude_model`` for runtime validation used by the
